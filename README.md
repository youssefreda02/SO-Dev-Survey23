# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 - Remote vs Onsite Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes key trends from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024, comparing remote, hybrid, and onsite work environments across several metrics. The goal is to explore how different work setups influence job satisfaction, salary, and the adoption of AI tools in development workflows.

## Key questions to be answerd
1. Job Satisfaction: How does job satisfaction vary across remote, hybrid, and onsite work types?
2. Salary Comparison: How does total compensation (salary) differ across these work setups?
3. AI Adoption: What is the relationship between remote work type and the likelihood of adopting AI tools?
4. Additional comparison

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).
I have not uploaded it because it's too large. So, Please **download** the dataset first.

## Tools & Libraries Used
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/youssefreda02/SO-Dev-Survey23.git
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Jupyter Notebook
The analysis is provided in the notebook.ipynb file. Open it locally or view it on GitHub.

## Insights Summary
* Remote Work Satisfaction: A detailed breakdown of how job satisfaction is distributed across different work setups.
* Salary Trends: Explore how compensation varies depending on work type.
* AI Tool Adoption: Understand the impact of remote work on the adoption of AI tools in development workflows.
* More Comparisons: Looking at the need of help from outside the team, interactions and more.

## Summary of the Results

In this analysis, we explored the relationship between remote work type and various key factors like job satisfaction, total compensation, and the adoption of AI tools. We discovered notable trends, including:
* Job satisfaction tends to be higher among remote workers compared to onsite employees.
* Remote workers generally receive higher compensation than their onsite counterparts.
* Remote and hybrid workers show a higher tendency to adopt AI tools in their workflow compared to onsite workers.
