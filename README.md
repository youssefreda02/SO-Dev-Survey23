# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 - Remote vs Onsite Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes key trends from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024, comparing remote, hybrid, and onsite work environments across several metrics. The goal is to explore how different work setups influence job satisfaction, salary, and the adoption of AI tools in development workflows.

## Key questions to be answerd
1. Job Satisfaction: How does job satisfaction vary across remote, hybrid, and onsite work types?
2. Salary Comparison: How does total compensation (salary) differ across these work setups?
3. AI Adoption: What is the relationship between remote work type and the likelihood of adopting AI tools?
4. Additional comparison
